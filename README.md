## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nvmwhoiam/card-brand-validator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh

## Usage

Test the validator with these valid example numbers:

- Visa: `4263 9826 4026 9299`
- Mastercard: `5425 2334 3010 9903`
- American Express: `3782 8224 6310 005`
